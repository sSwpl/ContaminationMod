# ContaminationMod
This is simple 1.20.1 Forge Mod, that adds real-time configurable invisible barrier. When you cross it, you start to recieve damage. Only way to stop taking damage is to use Lugol's Iodine, it gives you some time when you can explore the world beyond barrier(duration is also configurable). It adds rather simple looking bar at the top of your screen with a timer for how long Lugol's Iodine works.
For now this item is accessible trough creative inventory in indigrients tab.
This is the core and really basic implementation, mostly proof of concept. Maybe I'll update it later on.
If you want to configure duration and barrier look inside config folder.
