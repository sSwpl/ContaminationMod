# ContaminationMod
This is simple 1.20.1 Forge Mod, that adds real-time configurable invisible barrier. When you cross it, you start to recieve damage. Only way to stop taking damage is to use Lugol's Iodine, it gives you some time when you can explore the world beyond barrier(duration is also configurable)
